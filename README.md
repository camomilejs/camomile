**Camomile** is a toolkit that helps you automate tiresome tasks you normally have to perform in your project: building, linting, testing, and packaging.

> Warning: Camomile is a Work In Progress. No functions are currently available.

**Camomile** is like Gulp, but better:
it has fewer dependencies so that resolution is quicker and the installation size is smaller
it is thoroughly typed to minimize configuration errors
its API is even simpler letting you create your plugins in no time.
